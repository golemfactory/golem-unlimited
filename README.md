# Golem Unlimited 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/golemfactory/golem-unlimited.svg?branch=release%2F0.2)](https://travis-ci.org/golemfactory/golem-unlimited)

Golem Unlimited utilizes **trusted** heterogeneous computing resources which are part time idle. It is meant for data center-like setup (e.g., render farms, or desktops within organisation LAN) where network participants trust each other, but it will also support trusted P2P subnetworks (e.g., distributed team machines).

It features the [hub](gu-hub) acting as a requestor and additional worker nodes in the hubâ€™s trusted network acting as [providers](gu-provider).

Trust within Golem Unlimited subnetwork allows simplifying its design and taking care of only the computation layer. Other components such as economic layers, reputation systems, verification algorithms, and sandboxing (in contrast to the public Golem Network) can be skipped altogether or implemented optionally.

Golem Unlimited joint resources can be used to perform tasks for internal requestor - the hub operator - with no fee. At the same time the hub will be able to expose its subordinate trusted providers to the public [Golem](../../../golem) Network. In such a setting hub will act as a provider and earn GNTs.  

The latter broadens [Golem](../../../golem) Network reach, because it currently supports just single machine nodes. With Golem Unlimited it would allow more complex components, such as a whole subnetworks.

# Use cases
So far we have prepared plugins for two use cases:
* Integer factorization
* Mining 

We will open source those plugins soon.

# Installing and testing

Please bear in mind that Golem Unlimited is in its [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) stage.

## binary
To install you can use the [released](../../releases) Ubuntu `deb` and MacOs `dmg` binary packages.

The detailed steps can be found in our demo https://youtu.be/J0LBdg2j6Tk

## from source
To run the hub, please go to the `gu-hub` subdir and perform:
```
$ cargo run -- -vv server run
```

To configure the provider, please go to `gu-provider` subdir and run:
```
$ cargo run configure
```

Please select your hub and save the configuration. Now you can run the provider:
```
$ cargo run -- -vv server run
```

# Usage
See our demo for sample usage
https://youtu.be/J0LBdg2j6Tk

Both [hub](gu-hub) and [provider](gu-provider) can be configured via CLI. Invoke them with `help` command to see what's possible.

The [hub](gu-hub) comes also with web UI at:
